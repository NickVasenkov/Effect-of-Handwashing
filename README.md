 Statistical analysis of the effect of handwashing policy on hospital death rates:

We'll be using datasets collected by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, the discoverer of the benefits of handwashing. He presented this data to medical scientists without statistical arguments and visualisations (that was almost 200 years ago), and his discovery was rejected and ridiculed. We'll fix this now, using graphs and a bootstrap analysis.
